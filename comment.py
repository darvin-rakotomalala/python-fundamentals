Comments in Python are the lines in the code that are ignored by the interpreter
during the execution of the program.
- Comments enhance the readability of the code.
- Comment can be used to identify functionality or structure the code-base.
- Comment can help understanding unusual or tricky scenarios handled by the code to prevent accidental removal or changes.
- Comments can be used to prevent executing any specific part of your code, while making changes or testing.

"""
Best Practice to Write Comments
- Comments should be short and precise.
- Use comments only when necessary, donâ€™t clutter your code with comments.
- Avoid writing generic or basic comments.
- Write comments that are self explanatory.
